<h1>Hi, This is Tony, Experienced Full Stack Developer. ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zou-wang-88397519a/"><h4><i>"Tony is a very skilled programmer and project manager. I've had the pleasure of working with him, and he's not only a great guy, but he's an excellent problem-solver. We had a platform that was a mess from another programmer when we passed it along, and he was able to assess the situation, make a suggestion, and execute the project on time and on budget. I would recommend considering Tony in the mix should you have a project that is a good fit."</h4></i></a>

- ðŸ”­ Recently, I have been working on a project aimed at giving our customers the ability to improve the citywave service in our mobile and web apps alongside the existing Citywavemard.com. Although this project has been a very fast-paced and challenging one, itâ€™s been highly rewarding having the chance to work end to end on a project that has complexity not only from the engineering side but also from the product and operations side. And, itâ€™s been even more rewarding knowing that we are building something our customers will use and love from the moment we launch.
