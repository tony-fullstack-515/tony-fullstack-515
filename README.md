<h1>Hi, This is Tony, experienced full stack developer. 👋</h1>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zou-wang-88397519a/"><h4><i>"Tony is a very skilled programmer and project manager. I've had the pleasure of working with him, and he's not only a great guy, but he's an excellent problem-solver. We had a platform that was a mess from another programmer when we passed it along, and he was able to assess the situation, make a suggestion, and execute the project on time and on budget. I would recommend considering Tony in the mix should you have a project that is a good fit"</h4></i></a>
